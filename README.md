## About the client
Connect 5 is a UK-wide mental wellbeing promotion training programme developed from a unique collaboration between Public Health England (PHE) & Health Education England (HEE). It is designed to increase the confidence and core skills of front line staff so that they can be more effective in having conversations about mental health and wellbeing, help people to manage mental health problems and increase their resilience and mental wellbeing through positive changes.

The app aims to facilitate Connect 5’s internal organisation process while integrating Behavioural Insight Surveying Analysis for in depth user feedback and research purposes conducted by Manchester University.

## About the App
The Connect 5 app is a joint effort between Connect 5, the University of Manchester and Yalla
Cooperative (software development across the UK and Gaza). A total of 5 sprints (software
development periods) lead towards the creation of a tool that can be used as the one organisation
and data collection tool to manage and evaluate Connect 5 sessions. During 5 sprints we've followed an agile software development approach. Agile meaning a user centred development approach as a combination between software design, user testing and development.

## Testimonial by Product Owner
My experience of the tech for health programme and Yalla was overwhelmingly positive. The people building my app (both here in London and in Gaza) demonstrated high quality levels of attention and application to produce a product which exactly serves my project’s needs. It is a project that is highly complex; with different levels of users, different sessions and complex data collection pathways. The team, listened closely to me (who has no knowledge app building) asked questions that got beneath the skin of what was needed. I felt they really understood my produce and my needs.  The time I spent with the team and the interactions during the sprint always felt productive as well as being a pleasure
